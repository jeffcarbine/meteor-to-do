# meteor-to-do

# Build instructions
`npm install` and then `meteor` to run the app

# What I learned
Meteor was a lot faster to go through than the other frameworks I had worked with. It was really cool that it already talks to Mongo for you so you don't have to set it up yourself. It's also cool how it keeps HTML and JS apart (unless you are using the React version, of course) which makes it pretty easy to use.

#What you found difficult
The tutorial went fast (I mean, I was reading it, so it went by as fast as I read it) in the sense that it didn't go into _that_ much detail. So, if I needed to build my own project in Meteor, I would have to read through it again and again to understand it, whereas other tutorials we have done in this class have been a bit more clearer in the precise workings of their framework.

#What are the advantages to branching in Git?
As far as these assignments are concerned: not much. I mean, there are a bunch of arbitrary commits and branches. I built the same thing twice with different frameworks, and I really think the second one was kind of pointless because we have alrady gone over react. But enough rambling: in an actual scenario, you need multiple branches in order to keep development code from being deployed. So, if we had actually built an app and I was assigned to make a new feature, I would create that new feature in a branch. Then, when it was production ready, we would merge it back into the master branch and it would be deployed in the project.
